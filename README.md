# Getting Started Our Final Project

## Install

Before you run the code, you need to run `npm install` first to install all the dependencies to your localhost

## Start the frontend

Open a terminal in the root folder and run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Start the backend

Open another terminal in the ./src/utils and run:

### `node get.js`

This will run a backend server at `localhost:3306`

## Ready to go
